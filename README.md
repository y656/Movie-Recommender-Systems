# Movie-Recommender-Systems

This repositories contain different recommender systems applied on the famous MovieLens 20M dataset.<br /> 
It contains three repositories:
1. Demographic Filtering
2. Content Based Filtering
3. Collaborative Filtering

### Demographic Filtering

<br />

Do not worry if the predicted top movies are not same as the user's top recommendations. Here, we completed the utility matrix and predicted which movies have got the highest rating. Based on a particular user, if the user has rated other movies which he did not rate previously, then we understand the user and estimate the ratings he will give to new ones. May be some new movies which the user did not rate has got good ratings, hence we recommend those. 

**Hence this system performs good at personalizing recommendations and understanding the user better.**

``` Kudos, finally we are able to create a personalized system for users in our dataset. ```
